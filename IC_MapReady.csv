You may find out if we are for real before going out on a limb, though, that is if you don’t believe for what we say but also need to believe for what we do, which is necessary for some as that there are false brothers about whom say,, but do not do as they say(these were called pharisees in Jesus’ day). but this lamp shines on a hill, not under a bushel, so think only that we are to confess Him as Lord and welcome all praise to His Name and trying of our ways because we confess Him in our words and deeds.

The Guest Center of Tamera is meeting place, home and study space for a growing international community of people. We warmly welcome you to get to know Tamera, its specific projects and people, and especially the vision of a new Earth.
You visit an emerging new culture that rattles conventional thinking and behavioral patterns. In the following, we want to give an introduction as to what you can expect in such an unconventional environment:
We are working to take all areas of life back to our own responsibility. This also concerns the material supply of food, energy and water. We learn from the cooperation with nature what it means to live again in wealth and real abundance and receive nature’s gifts with gratitude. We meet all creatures, even the smallest, with mindfulness and respect. They, just as we humans, belong to the great family of life.
We invite all our guests to get involved in a simple life in community during the period of your stay. You will get to know a communitarian lifestyle, meeting over meals, working together and sleeping in dormitories. Our kitchens serve vegan meals from predominantly regionally produced and organic food. The night lights up with a sea of stars, but there are no street lights.

In practical terms, this project is suitable both for people, who want to “escape” from urban life and also for these, who for various reasons cannot do this permanently, but would like to have the opportunity to become a part of such an undertaking and the chance to experience a temporary retreat from their own environment.
At this starting point there are several basic options anyone can choose from, based on the phases of the project development:
 Core Xperiment members – the initial group of people, which begin the actual work of restoring the space and the house in the mountain village for the needs of the project. They invest their physical work and the initial funds, which are needed to complete the first phases of the project. Also they will become the permanent members of the project with their own personal living space and take part in creating the concepts, social design and basic rules of the Xperiment.
Xperiment members – the people that actively help with the physical, artistic and intellectual work in all phases of the project from its beginning and create, develop and organize events and activities throughout the whole process.
Volunteer members – everyone, who visits the Xperiment space temporarily and help with anything from growing food to giving ideas and being part of the whole development process. Lodging and food will be provided for everyone, who decides to join as a volunteer in the period between May and September 2018, when most of the work on repairing the house will be done. Additional information will be provided upon request.
Surrounding circle members – the individuals, groups or families, living in other houses around the Xperiment place. They represent the friendly circle, which will help in the development of the social aspect of the project. They share our vision, take part in the events and always be the “good neighbour” with whom we will break bread and exchange ideas.
Participants – everyone, who will either organize or be part of the cultural, social and spiritual events, which will begin taking place in the space, once it is ready to accommodate them.
Contributors – everyone, who is not yet physically, but is financially able to assist in the creation of the space for the Xperiment and wants to have the option to become a future visitor, participant or member of the project. Please see the Contribute section of this website for more information.
Every person, who joins the project in any of the above ways, will be given access to the Xperiment site at all stages of its development and depending on the personal contribution and one’s desire will become an integral part of the project, once it becomes operational in all its aspects and begins to achieve its goals.
